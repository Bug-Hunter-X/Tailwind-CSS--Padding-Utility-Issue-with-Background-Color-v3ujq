# Tailwind CSS Padding Bug
This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS's padding utility classes in conjunction with background color classes.

## Bug Description
When applying both background color (e.g., `bg-gray-200`) and padding (e.g., `p-4`) classes to an element, the padding does not apply correctly resulting in unexpected layout.  This seems to be specific to certain scenarios, potentially related to the order of classes, parent elements, or other interactions.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run  `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server. 
4. Observe the unexpected layout of the component in the browser.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring proper usage of Tailwind's padding utility classes and potentially exploring alternative solutions for the layout if the standard padding utilities don't work as expected in all circumstances.

## Technologies Used
* Tailwind CSS
* React (or other framework as appropriate)
